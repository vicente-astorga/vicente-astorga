### Hi, I'm Vicente

Frontend developer. I love impactful web experiences that drive value. A good design and interactive elements that makes an enjoyable user's journey across the web 🛤, capturing their attention from the first moment.

For small projects or ideas I like to work without frameworks, which allows me a complete development management. I use vanilla JS in the base, GSAP for animations and Three.js for WebGL 🎞.

I always try to do a conscious development, finding the root of the problem to get well-built code 💡. I'm curious to keep learning new technologies and improving in the process.

About me, in my free time I like to go out, to know new places, to discover new things 🏔. I like the photograpy 📸 and listen to music, especialy deep house. And above all, I love to drink coffee ☕.
